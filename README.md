# Swiggy Annual Report — RAG Q&A System

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that answers natural
language questions about Swiggy's FY 2023-24 Annual Report, grounded
strictly in the document content (no hallucination).

## Source Document

- **Document:** Swiggy Annual Report FY 2023-24
- **Source:** Publicly available on Swiggy's investor relations site
  (BSE/NSE filings) — place the PDF at `data/Swiggy_Annual_Report_FY2023-24.pdf`
  before running ingestion. *(Add the exact URL you downloaded it from here.)*

## Architecture

```
PDF (170 pages)
   │  pypdf: extract text per page
   ▼
Cleaning + Chunking (LangChain RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter,
   1000 chars / 150 overlap, page-number metadata retained)
   ▼
Embeddings (sentence-transformers: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 — local, free, no API key)
   ▼
FAISS vector index (cosine similarity via normalized inner product)
   ▼
User query → embed → top-k retrieval → context-only prompt → local LLM (Ollama)
   ▼
Answer + supporting context (with page numbers)
```

## Why these choices

- **Embeddings:** `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` is small, fast, fully local, and
  requires no API key — good for an assignment that should run anywhere.
- **Vector store:** FAISS is lightweight, in-process, and needs no
  external service.
- **LLM:** Ollama runs models like Llama 3.1 locally, keeping the whole
  pipeline free and offline. Swap `OLLAMA_MODEL` env var for any model
  you've pulled (e.g. `mistral`, `phi3`).
- **Strict grounding:** the system prompt instructs the model to answer
  only from retrieved context and to explicitly say when information
  isn't present, reducing hallucination.

## Setup

### 1. Install Python dependencies

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Install and start Ollama

Download from https://ollama.com, then pull a model:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1
```

Ollama runs as a local server in the background automatically after install.

### 3. Add the document

Place the annual report PDF at:

```
data/Swiggy_Annual_Report_FY2023-24.pdf
```

### 4. Build the vector index (run once, or whenever the PDF changes)

```bash
python src/ingest.py
```

This creates `vectorstore/faiss.index` and `vectorstore/chunks.pkl`.

### 5. Ask questions

**CLI:**

```bash
python src/cli.py
```

**Web UI (Streamlit):**

```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

### Using different LLM providers

- The system supports local Ollama models and cloud APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini).
- Set the default provider with `LLM_PROVIDER` (e.g. `export LLM_PROVIDER=openai`).
- Set API keys as environment variables when using cloud providers:

```bash
# OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

# Anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="..."

# Google Gemini
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="..."
```

In the CLI you can choose the provider at startup. In the Streamlit UI use the `LLM provider` selector.

## Example questions to try

- "What was Swiggy's total revenue from operations in FY24?"
- "What are the key risk factors mentioned in the report?"
- "Who are the members of Swiggy's board of directors?"
- "What is Swiggy's strategy for profitability?"

## Notes / limitations

- Answer quality depends on the local LLM chosen via Ollama — larger
  models (e.g. `llama3.1:70b`) give better reasoning at the cost of speed.
- Table-heavy financial pages may extract imperfectly with `pypdf`;
  for production use, consider a layout-aware extractor (e.g. `pdfplumber`
  or `unstructured`) for tables.
- Re-run `ingest.py` any time the source PDF changes.
